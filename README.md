# live_mouse_control_using_hand_gestures
This project implements a real-time hand gesture-based mouse controller using computer vision and AI. The system allows users to control the mouse cursor, perform left click, right click, and take screenshots, all without touching the physical mouse â€” just by using simple hand gestures captured through a webcam.
